CraftColony - Potions Pack v1.0
------------------------------------------------------------

Hi! Thanks for buying the CraftColony Potions Pack!

I'm very glad to be able to provide a set of high-quality, low-poly models for you and your projects.


A few notes:

THE MODELS
------------------------------------------------------------
- The models are designed for re-use.
- A great example of this is the liquid model and material on each potion.
- Any material can be applied to any liquid model. The UV mapping on the models have been prepared for this.
- Also, the corks from each bottle will fit every other bottle.


THE TEXTURES & MATERIALS
------------------------------------------------------------
- The textures have been imported at Automatic Truecolor with Mipmaps.
- If you need smaller textures in your game, you can try the following:
	- reduce this to Automatic Compressed
	- choose a Max Size that meets your needs
	- turn off Generate Mip Maps if you don't need it
- An example:
	- Liquid Blue Red has a size of 1.0MB when using my default import settings.
	- Making these changes:
		- reducing it to Automatic Compressed
		- reducing the size to 256x256;
		- and turning off Generate Mip Maps, makes the new size 32KB. That's a HUGE savings!
	- We HIGHLY RECOMMEND you make these changes to suit the needs of your project, especially if deploying to mobile platforms.
	- We don't make these changes by default to maintain the highest visual quality of the product when you receive it.


Thanks again! Here's wishing you many potion-brewing hours of fun!

Rustum Scammell,
